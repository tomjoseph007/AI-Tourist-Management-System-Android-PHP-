Smart tourist Guiding system


The proposed system is a web based and android application and maintains 
a centralized repository of all related information. The system allows one to easily 
access the relevant information and make necessary travel arrangements. Tourists 
can decide about places they want to visit and make bookings online for travel 
packages. Without any price the tourists get all information of the tourist’s 
destination in the particular region. Our project also provide the help of local 
travel guides. The tourist can login to our websites and they can use all facilities. 
The travel guide and drivers is provided with an android application they get all 
information of tourists who requested for your services. The local guide can add 
the detail and photographs of unexploded places. The tourists can pay package 
amounts and fees through online.
